I am currently an undergraduate student in Peking University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Guojie Song](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/teaching/inservice/search/detail/?id=5526). I also enjoy working with [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) as a research intern in the summer of 2019 in Montreal. I will join the University of Southern California in 2019.
