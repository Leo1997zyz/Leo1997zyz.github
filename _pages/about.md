I am an Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science at the Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern Californi. I am advised by [Prof. Yan Liu](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/). I received my bachelor degree from Peking University, working with [Prof. Guojie Song](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/teaching/inservice/search/detail/?id=5526). I also enjoy working with [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) as a research intern in the summer of 2019 in Montreal.
